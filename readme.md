#What is Progress Bar ?


**Progress bar**  or progress indicator element displays the progress of the amount of tasks completed out of the total amount of tasks (which is 100% ).

Generally we denote the amount of progress happening using percentage( % ) signs e.g. 50% etc in HTML5 we have a progress indicator or progress bar element

```
   <progress> Progress </progress>
```
progress element has two attributes


**max & value**
```
